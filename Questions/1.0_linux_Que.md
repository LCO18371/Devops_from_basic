### Commands to List All Users and Groups

#### List All Users
1. **View `/etc/passwd` file**:
    ```bash
    cat /etc/passwd
    ```
    Each line represents a user.

2. **Using `cut` command**:
    ```bash
    cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd
    ```
    This extracts only the usernames.

3. **Using `getent` command**:
    ```bash
    getent passwd
    ```
    This retrieves user information from the system database.

#### List All Groups
1. **View `/etc/group` file**:
    ```bash
    cat /etc/group
    ```
    Each line represents a group.

2. **Using `cut` command**:
    ```bash
    cut -d: -f1 /etc/group
    ```
    This extracts only the group names.

3. **Using `getent` command**:
    ```bash
    getent group
    ```
    This retrieves group information from the system database.
#### Search and Replace in Vim

    To search and replace a word in Vim, you can use the following command:

    ```vim
    :%s/old_word/new_word/g
    ```

    - `:%s` - This specifies that the substitution should happen in the entire file.
    - `old_word` - The word you want to search for.
    - `new_word` - The word you want to replace it with.
    - `g` - This flag ensures that all occurrences in a line are replaced. Without it, only the first occurrence in each line will be replaced.

    For example, to replace all occurrences of "foo" with "bar" in the file, you would use:

    ```vim
    :%s/foo/bar/g
    ```

    To confirm each replacement interactively, add the `c` flag:

    ```vim
    :%s/old_word/new_word/gc
    ```
