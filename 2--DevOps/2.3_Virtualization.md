# Life Before Virtualization  

Before virtualization, managing IT infrastructure was a challenging and inefficient process. Here's how life looked:  

- **To Run Applications/Services, We Needed Servers**  
    Every application or service required its own dedicated physical server.  

- **Physical Computers (Servers in Datacenters)**  
    Datacenters were filled with physical servers, each consuming space, power, and cooling resources.  

- **One Service - One Server (Isolation)**  
    To ensure isolation and avoid conflicts, each service was deployed on a separate server.  

- **Servers Were Always Overprovisioned**  
    Servers were configured with more resources than needed to handle peak loads, leading to inefficiency.  

- **Server Resources Were Mostly Underutilized**  
    Most of the time, servers operated far below their capacity, wasting valuable resources.  

- **Huge Capital Expenditure (CapEx) and Operational Expenditure (OpEx)**  
    Organizations faced high costs for purchasing, maintaining, and operating physical servers.  

This inefficiency paved the way for **virtualization**, which revolutionized IT infrastructure by allowing one physical computer to run multiple operating systems.  

### What is Virtualization?  
Virtualization is the process of partitioning physical resources into virtual resources. It enables one computer to do the job of many by running multiple isolated operating systems (not multitasking).  

### How It Started  
Virtualization began with technologies like **VMware**, which allowed a single physical machine to host multiple virtual machines (VMs). Each VM operates independently, with its own OS and applications, while sharing the underlying hardware.  

### Virtual Machine Architecture  
Below is a simplified architecture of virtualization:  

```
+--------------------------------------------+
| Application Layer                          |
+--------------------------------------------+
| Guest OS (VM1->window-> application)       |
| Guest OS (VM2->linux-> application)        |
| Guest OS (VM3-> ubuntu-> applictaion)      |
+--------------------------------------------+
| Hypervisor                                 |
+--------------------------------------------+
| Physical Hardware                          |
+--------------------------------------------+
```

With virtualization, organizations could consolidate servers, reduce costs, and improve resource utilization. It marked the beginning of a new era in IT infrastructure.  
### Types of Hypervisors  

Hypervisors are the core technology that enables virtualization. They allow multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical server by abstracting the hardware. There are two main types of hypervisors:  

#### 1. Type-1 Hypervisor (Bare Metal)  
- Runs directly on the physical server (host OS).  
- Provides high performance and is used in production environments.  
- Can be clustered together for high availability and resource pooling.  

**Diagram:**  
```
+--------------------------------------------+
| Virtual Machine (VM1)                      |
|   - Guest OS                               |
| Virtual Machine (VM2)                      |
|   - Guest OS                               |
+--------------------------------------------+
| Type-1 Hypervisor                          |
+--------------------------------------------+
| Physical Hardware                          |
+--------------------------------------------+
```

#### 2. Type-2 Hypervisor (Hosted)  
- Runs as software on top of an existing operating system (host OS).  
- Primarily used for learning, testing, and development purposes.  
- Examples include VirtualBox, VMware Workstation, and Oracle VM Server.  

**Diagram:**  
```
+--------------------------------------------+
| Virtual Machine (VM1)                      |
|   - Guest OS                               |
| Virtual Machine (VM2)                      |
|   - Guest OS                               |
+--------------------------------------------+
| Type-2 Hypervisor                          |
+--------------------------------------------+
| Host Operating System                      |
+--------------------------------------------+
| Physical Hardware                          |
+--------------------------------------------+
```

Hypervisors play a crucial role in modern IT infrastructure by enabling efficient resource utilization and flexibility.  
### Creating a Virtual Machine (VM) Setup  

To create a VM setup, you can follow two methods: **Manual** and **Automated**. Below are the steps for each method:  

#### Prerequisites  
- A 64-bit computer  
- Internet connection  
- Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux  
- Optional tools: Oracle VirtualBox, ISO file, login tools (Git Bash, PuTTY)  

---

### Manual Method  
In Window 1st enable virtualisation in BIOS.
enable vtx or if you can see Secure virtual machine. Also Disable other window virtualisation like Microsoft Hyperv, window hypervisor platform, docker desktop, vm platform like shown in fig.
![Disable other window hypervisor](/assets/Disable_other_win_hyper.png)

-- Reboot your computer.


1. **Install VirtualBox**  
    - Download and install Oracle VirtualBox from [https://www.virtualbox.org/](https://www.virtualbox.org/).  

2. **Download ISO File**  
    - Obtain the ISO file for the desired Linux distribution (e.g., CentOS, Ubuntu) from their official websites.  

3. **Create a New Virtual Machine**  
    - Open VirtualBox and click on `New`.  
    - Provide a name for the VM and select the operating system type (e.g., Linux) and version (e.g., Ubuntu 64-bit).  

4. **Allocate Resources**  
    - Assign memory (RAM) and CPU cores to the VM based on your system's capacity.  

5. **Attach ISO File**  
    - Go to the VM's settings, navigate to `Storage`, and attach the downloaded ISO file as a virtual optical disk.  

6. **Start the VM**  
    - Start the VM and follow the on-screen instructions to install the operating system.  

7. **Install Additional Tools**  
    - After installation, set up tools like Git Bash or PuTTY for remote access and management.  

Manual drawback:
- Os installation
- Time consuming
- Manual-> human error
- tough to replicate multi vm
- need to document entire step.

### Automated Method  

For automation, you can use **Vagrant** with VirtualBox.  

1. **Install VirtualBox**  
    - Download and install Oracle VirtualBox.  

2. **Install Vagrant**  
    - Download and install Vagrant from [https://www.vagrantup.com/](https://www.vagrantup.com/).  

3. **Initialize Vagrant**  
    - Open a terminal and create a new directory for your VM setup:  
      ```bash
      mkdir my-vm-setup && cd my-vm-setup
      vagrant init
      ```  

4. **Edit the Vagrantfile**  
    - Open the `Vagrantfile` and configure the desired Linux VM. For example, to set up an Ubuntu VM:  
      ```ruby
      Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
         config.vm.box = "ubuntu/bionic64" # Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
         config.vm.network "private_network", type: "dhcp"
         config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
            vb.memory = "2048"
            vb.cpus = 2
         end
      end
      ```  

5. **Start the VM**  
    - Run the following command to start the VM:  
      ```bash
      vagrant up
      ```  

6. **Access the VM**  
    - SSH into the VM using:  
      ```bash
      vagrant ssh
      ```  

7. **Provisioning (Optional)**  
    - Automate software installation and configuration by adding provisioning scripts to the `Vagrantfile`. For example:  
      ```ruby
      config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
         sudo apt-get update
         sudo apt-get install -y nginx
      SHELL
      ```

Both methods allow you to set up Linux VMs (e.g., CentOS, Ubuntu) for development, testing, or learning purposes. Choose the method that best suits your needs.
